    <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Red Five standing by. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
    <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. <strong> I don't know what you're talking about.</strong> <em> I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Hey, Luke!</em> May the Force be with you.</p>

    <h2>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</h2>
    <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>He is here.</li><li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</li><li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li>

    <h3>I want to come with you to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderaan">Alderaan</a>. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</h3>
    <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</li><li>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</li><li>I'm trying not to, kid.</li>

    <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
    <p>He is here. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
    <p>Red Five standing by. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… I call it luck. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>

    <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Don't underestimate the Force. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
    <p>Red Five standing by. As you wish. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
    <p>You mean it controls your actions? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
    <p>Don't underestimate the Force. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Ye-ha! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
    <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. He is here. What?! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
    <p>I'm trying not to, kid. Don't underestimate the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
